    This algorithm is used as test instance for the simulator. The placement and routing is predefined, but the
    corresponding control entries are registered dynamically at run time.
    The algorithm interacts with the simulator in various ways. Callback functions are registered, so that
    the internal flowsimulator can directly execute the algorithm at certain events. In some cases the algorithm is
    then provided with additional event information. In general the algorithm queries the current network state from
    the simulator interface. The simulator state is composed of original and referenced data. Therefore the algorithm
    directly operates on parts of the internal simulator state. Nevertheless the algorithm has to call simulator.apply
    to let all changes come into effect.
